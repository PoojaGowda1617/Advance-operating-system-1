Advanced-OS-6378-Project1
=========================

Project to implement Ricart-Agrawala algorithm for distributed mutual exclusion, with the optimization proposed by Roucairol and Carvalho, in a client-server model, where client and server act like peers.


Steps to Run the program:
==========================

The server and the client files are to be copied to a total of 8 different machines (5 clients and 3 servers)


The command to run the server:
==============================
Before running the server, 3 folders, one corresponding to each server must be created in the file system. All these 3 folders must be in the same location.Files folder must be placed in each server folder and it should be same across all the servers.

gcc -pthread server.c
./a.out <server_id> <port_no>   (server_id denotes the server number and it must be a number from 0 to 2)


The command to run the client:
==============================

All 5 client folders must be in the same location as the server.

gcc -pthread client.c
./a.out <client_id> <port_no>  (client_id denotes the client number and it must be a number from 0 to 4)


Important points to remember
============================

Each excution of servers and clients will write an entry(ip address and the port number) into the config files(placed in config folder at root).
servers will write in serverconfig.txt and clients write in clientconfig.txt

Prior to next execution, the contents of serverconfig.txt and clientconfig.txt files must be manually deleted.

Servers must be executed first, i.e, before the execution of clients. servers and clients must be executed in order. This means, first server1 ,server2 ....client1 client2..on different machines.
